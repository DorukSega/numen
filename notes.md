## Plans

boolean type
: either have it be numbers like C or custom type entirely

---

if else syntax
: maybe this?
: figure out how to parse end with function ends

     <cond> if
     <exec>
     else <cond> if
     <exec>
     end

---

`funcname + s` syntax
: for example print, used as `"lol" "test" 2 prints`
: it should print two of the arguments instead of one
: or turn this to a **x times** thing like this
: `"lol" "test" [2] prints` which should print twice
